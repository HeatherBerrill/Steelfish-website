<h2>Steelfish Website</h2>

A website created whilst completing Jonas Schmedtmann's Advanced CSS and SASS course on Udemy. This project is for learning and demonstrating styling, animations and effects. It has minimal functionality. The surf company is a fictional company. I am also responsible for the logo design. It has been designed desktop first and is still in the process of responsive styling for mobile and tablet screens.

This website is hosted on netlify and can be viewed here...

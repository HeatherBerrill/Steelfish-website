<h2>Steelfish Website</h2>

A website created whilst completing Jonas Schmedtmann's Advanced CSS and SASS course on Udemy. This project is for learning and demonstrating styling, animations and effects. It has minimal functionality. The surf company is a fictional company. I am also responsible for the logo design.
